# Anagram
A short program to check if two strings are anagrams

Anagram:a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.

Essentially the program sorts the phrase (which is typed in without punctuations) and compares the two without spaces. 
Similar to a palindrome problem, it is a fun, short program with words that can be solved with some short functions.

In this program, I used selection sort. For future optimizations I should change it to another sorting function, but in our case we are assuming the phrases typed in are generally succinct.
